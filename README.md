Project Title: Train Schedule Web Application (Full Stack Project)

Description:
Developed a responsive React-based web application that displays train schedules using data from a custom backend API. The application consists of two main pages: one for displaying a list of all trains and another for showing detailed information about a single train. Implemented API calls, routing, and user interface components to enhance user experience and effectively present train information.

Technologies Used:
React
Axios for API calls
Material-UI for styling and responsive design
React Router for navigation
Node.js for the backend server

Key Accomplishments:
Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface that allows users to view and explore train schedules with ease.
Successfully integrated frontend and backend components to fetch and display real-time train data.
Demonstrated proficiency in utilizing third-party libraries and tools to improve the project's functionality and appearance.
Future Enhancements:

Implement additional sorting and filtering options to further enhance user experience.
Add user authentication to personalize the experience for registered users.
Integrate live updates for train schedules to provide real-time information.
